# Create Revit Schedules on Web | SpecklePy Tutorial

In this tutorial, you are going to assemble a quick web application that will display Revit data (sent via Speckle) in a table format using nothing but Python 🐍. You will learn quite a few things:

- how to connect to Speckle server
- how to receive Revit data and properties
- how to analyze and filter received data

It will be a great exercise to understand the basics of interacting with the Speckle server and Speckle data structure. Let's go 🚀!

## Requirements

Since we are going to use Python and deal with Speckle server, knowledge about both is assumed. But don’t worry, you don’t have to be an expert in Python, just being comfortable using it will let you get started.

To follow this tutorial you'll need the following libraries:

- Streamlit👑
- SpecklePy🔹
- Pandas🐼
